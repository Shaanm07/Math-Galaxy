# Name: Shaan Mehta
# Student ID: 735588
# Description: This is the Math Galaxy! This GUI-based math game has been
#              designed to help younger students practice the fundamentals of
#              math in an enjoyable way. By using interactive flashcards with
#              random numbers and operators, students can strengthen their math
#              skills while having fun. The game begins with a homepage that
#              welcomes the user and prompts them to view their options. Then,
#              the user is presented with various options for customization.
#              These options include choosing the level of difficulty, selecting
#              specific operators to focus on, the ability to include negative
#              numbers, and determining the number of questions to be asked.
#              Once the user has completely filled in all of the options, they
#              are directed to the game. Within the game, there are a range of
#              features to enhance user interface. These include intuitive
#              buttons such as "Back," "Start," "Enter," "Reset," and "Quit,"
#              ensuring smooth navigation throughout the game. As the user
#              progresses, the count of correct, wrong, and total attempts are
#              displayed. To keep students motivated and encourage better
#              results, a progress bar and stopwatch are shown as well.
#              The Math Galaxy provides a comprehensive platform for users
#              to practice their skills and become a math whiz!
